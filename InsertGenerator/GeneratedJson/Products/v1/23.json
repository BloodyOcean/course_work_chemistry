It is also a garbage-collected runtime system. Initially composing light-hearted and irreverent works, he also wrote serious, sombre and religious pieces beginning in the 1930s. The sequential subset of Erlang supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. Tuples are containers for a fixed number of Erlang data types.", "create_date": null, "update_date": null}
